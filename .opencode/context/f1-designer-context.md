### Backlog Details

#### #1: Race Simulation Overhaul
**Priority:** HIGH | **Complexity:** LARGE | **Est. Sessions:** 15-20

Complete F1 simulation overhaul with 4 interconnected phases:
- **Phase 1:** Foundation (2025 grid, team tiers, car/driver characteristics, synergy, fuel, pit stops)
- **Phase 2:** Tire System (compounds, degradation curves, cliff effect, wear interactions)
- **Phase 3:** Proximity Racing (dirty air, DRS/slipstream, alternative lines, overtaking)
- **Phase 4:** Drama (errors, last lap aggression, heat system, DRS trains, safety car restarts)

## User Preferences

### What They Like
- Drama and emergent stories
- Simcade feel (deep but accessible)
- Driver skill should matter
- Last lap battles, safety cars, mechanical failures

### Visual Preferences
- ASCII mockups work well
- Appreciates detailed specifications

---

## Design Patterns

### What Works
- Start with proposal, refine through conversation
- Ground designs in existing codebase
- Be honest about complexity

## Session History

### 2025-12-22 - Race Simulation Brainstorm
- **Duration:** Extended session
- **Outcome:** Complete 4-phase design saved to backlog
- **Notes:** Very productive session, user engaged with all aspects
