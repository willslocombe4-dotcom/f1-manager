# Deactivate Director

Set the F1 Director to **INACTIVE** mode.

## Instructions

1. Read `.opencode/context/f1-director-context.md`
2. Change `**Mode:** ACTIVE` to `**Mode:** INACTIVE`
3. Save the file
4. Respond with:

```
Director is now INACTIVE (Brainstorm Mode)

You can now freely brainstorm with @f1-idea-designer.
Ideas will be saved to the backlog for later implementation.

Say "/activate" or "/backlog" when you're ready to build.
```
