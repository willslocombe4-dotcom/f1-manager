  "task_description": "# Race Commentary Highlights\n\nDisplay text-based commentary for key race events like overtakes, pit stops, and fastest laps. Creates the feeling of watching an F1 broadcast with expert commentary highlighting important moments.\n\n## Rationale\nEnhances the F1 broadcast authenticity which is a key differentiator. Text commentary helps players follow the action without constant attention, making races more engaging than the 'non-interactive, boring' experience criticized in Grand Prix Story (pain-4-1).\n\n## User Stories\n- As an F1 fan, I want commentary on race events so that key moments feel significant\n- As a viewer, I want to see a history of recent events so that I can catch up if I miss something\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Commentary panel displays recent race events (last 3-5)\n- [ ] Events include: overtakes, pit stops, fastest laps, blue flags, race start/end\n- [ ] Commentary uses authentic F1 terminology and driver names\n- [ ] Commentary auto-scrolls but can be paused to review\n- [ ] Events are timestamped with current lap number\n",
