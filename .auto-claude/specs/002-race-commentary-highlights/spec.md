# Race Commentary Highlights

Display text-based commentary for key race events like overtakes, pit stops, and fastest laps. Creates the feeling of watching an F1 broadcast with expert commentary highlighting important moments.

## Rationale
Enhances the F1 broadcast authenticity which is a key differentiator. Text commentary helps players follow the action without constant attention, making races more engaging than the 'non-interactive, boring' experience criticized in Grand Prix Story (pain-4-1).

## User Stories

- [ ] Commentary uses authentic F1 terminology and driver names
- [ ] Commentary auto-scrolls but can be paused to review
